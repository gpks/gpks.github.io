<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I'm a web-developer, hopelessly in love with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I like clean, tested code,
    nice architecture and well-defined tasks. I can't stand unproductive discussions, I like to get my hands dirty in the most forgotten parts of application and make them really nice.
    In my free time I read, I watch good Netflix series, I can crochet simple things and I wear colourful socks every day.
